/*
Using the template below, update the page for the Year of Magical Thinking.

Summary (reword): Based on the National Book Award winner and Pulitzer Prize finalist,
memoir by Joan Didion. This play, adapted by the author herself,
recounts the year that both her husband and daughter died.
Starring powerhouse actress, Diane Kondrat, and featuring an original
violin score composed and performed by Michelle Alany, this story of
unexpected loss examines the power of grief and how we can heal
from its effects.

Directed by:  Patrick Walsh
